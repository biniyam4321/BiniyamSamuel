        <h1>   Face of Everyday fashion</h1>
     
        The phenomenon of fashion can be distinguished into elite fashion ( haute couture) and everyday
        fashion rather than just restricting ourselves to the concept of European or western high fashion.
        (Malcom barnard 1996, 2008) Everyday Fashion is an interactive process through which the
        aspiring individuals of the society consciously project their bodily self in a distinctive manner in
        the form of clothing style. it is unlike the traditional capitalist fashion system where the so called
        elite or rich decide the course of fashion tastes and fashion gets disseminated from the top to
        bottom sections of the society. This distinctive manner of style is equally drawn from the fashion
        trends percolated through contemporary life, style conventions, fashion code concepts developed
        by the designers & forecasting service providers alike and street style fashion, Appreciation of
        aesthetic experiences, ethnographic accounts witnessed in the social vicinity of a local
        population. (Malcolm barnard 1996, 2008) Relating to the beliefs and attitudes of the peers or
        social group these individuals belong to the Endeavour to draw a fine line between the existing
        patterns of style and their appearance by dressing in a trendy manner. In other words the
        intention is to win friends or draw appreciations by communicating their values in the form of
        dress and clothing as appearance is a social etiquette and effective form of nonverbal
        communication.<br></br>
