    <h1>Fashon Designer</h1>
    Fashion trends come and go; meanwhile a society’s values are established and evolving
characteristic to their beliefs and culture. Fashion is just not an ambitious projected image of a
reinterpreted good old value to fulfill some function or agenda alike but rather a evocative and
refreshing concept worthy enough to be portrayed for society’s appreciation that makes us even
more instinctive. In the society, the individual’s appearance is the ticket to transmit non verbal
communication signals such as possible cues about his / her social stature, values and lifestyle.
Fashion communication has under gone a 360 degree shift in its communicable aspects staring
from projecting a basic image of how we look like and how we feel like to expressing our
emotional experiences through interactive implements in the dress.
