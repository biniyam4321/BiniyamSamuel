    <h1> What Type of Designer Do You Need?</h1>
   
     Contemporary consumption behavior
    Todayâ€™s youth ( 15 to 20 years) given their predictable audacity, the tendency to shop, venture
    out, try, experiment is high, it is they who decide the life time of a fashion trend. In a globalized
    world well connected by web technologies, geographical distance is no more a constraint to
    reach and witness the experience. The lines between buying behaviors are no more significant
    among young people ( youth) indeed blurring out as the common urge is get hooked on to social
    networks, interact across a wide section of people of with shared interests and get appreciated.
    In fact even companies hiring potential job seekers are verifying their social networks and
    appraising them.
